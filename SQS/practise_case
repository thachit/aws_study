1.  Write a program for sending and receiving messages through SQS standard and FIFO queues.
    - Producer: send message to SQS
        + Connect to SQS
        + Send message
    - Consumer: receive message and print to the console
        + Connect to SQS
        + Send message

    -> Check:
        - Are messages automatically deleted in the Standard queue? No
        - Are messages automatically deleted in the FIFO queue? No
        - When Consumer 1 receives a message, after 10 seconds, Consumer 2 then receives a message. Can Consumer 1 delete the message? Yes

2.  Long polling (Receive message wait time)
    - Setup Receive message wait time for SQS queue is 10 seconds

    -> check:
        - How long does the consumer take to get a response from SQS if there are no messages? 10 seconds
        - If a producer sends a message during the <Long polling> period, how long does it take for the consumer to receive this message? Immediately
